# deduplicate-opensearch

This project is an updated fork of [deduplicate-elasticsearch](https://github.com/alexander-marquardt/deduplicate-elasticsearch) adapted to AWS OpenSearch and with some extra functions. 

A python script to detect duplicate documents in AWS OpenSearch. Once duplicates have been detected, it is straightforward to call a delete operation to remove duplicates.
